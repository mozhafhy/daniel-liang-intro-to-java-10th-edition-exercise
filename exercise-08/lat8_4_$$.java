(Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
employees are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employeeâ€™s seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, the following
array stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a program that displays
employees and their total hours in decreasing order of the total hours.
